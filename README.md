Welcome to Rolling Stock - a website dedicated to the economic card game designed by Bj√∂rn Rabenstein. Rolling Stock is a card game about stock and company trading. Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor. Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but is very different.
